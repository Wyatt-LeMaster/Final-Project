    <!-- Basketball Club -->
    <Group GID="G002">
        <name>Basketball Club</name>
        <Description>The goal of the AUBCT is to provide students the opportunity to compete on an organized basketball team against other collegiate club basketball teams across the country.  This will provide an environment for basketball players to continue competing, build friendships, and learn about the game of basketball. We will strive to promote sportsmanship and a competitive spirit for people with a love for basketball. We will seek to serve one another as we sacrifice the wants of each individual for the good of the team and University we represent. We compete in the National Club Basketball Association (NCBBA) and in our first 2 seasons we have won our Region each year, ending the season ranked 16 in the national poll our first year and ranked 13 in this yearsâ€™ poll, with our highest ranking being 6th in the country. This past year we also won the Andrew Sun Invitational Tournament at Florida State University after beating teams such as Clemson, Florida State, and Miami. We are looking to continue this success and be even more competitive in the years to come by selecting a team of guys who love basketball and love to compete. As a team, we are looking forward to the new group of guys this coming fall and spring as we have a lot of players on our team from last year graduating. </Description>
