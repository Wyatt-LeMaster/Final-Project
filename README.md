# COMP6000 Semester Project
### Members: Emma Ingram, Derius Knight, Wyatt LeMaster, Mary Mitchell, Nan Yang

### Introduction
For our project, we would like to develop a website that can connect local members of the community to other people in the area with similar interests. The website would allow a user to create an account, input their interests, and see nearby users with similar interests as well as their contact information so they can connect.<br><br>
Local groups that meet for various activities, such as pickleball, disc golf, running, baking, or any other activity, can post their meeting on the Meetings page. The website will suggest meetings to new users and also allow them to create a new event if they don’t find one that meets their interests. We also plan to recommend new activities, based on overlapping interests with people in the community.


### Proposal
